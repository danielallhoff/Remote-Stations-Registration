# Remote-Stations-Registration

This project makes possible the remote registration of stations (callable services) with the use of a .NET interface and the UDDI technology. Moreover, security functionality is implemented as: login with hashing and communication encryption (client - station). Furthermore, it is possible to subscribe to stations for receiving notifications when specified changes happen.
